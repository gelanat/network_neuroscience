This repository contains tutorials I have created as a part of my student-led undergraduate class on Network Neuroscience.
It features the following tutorials:
<br>
- using ...;
<br>
- using ...;
<br>
- on neural network approaches to network neuroscience: a tutorial on a simple neural network model for functional connectivity-based classification [here](https://github.com/gelanat/network_neuroscience/blob/master/NN_for_FC.ipynb).
